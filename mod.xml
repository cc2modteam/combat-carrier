** NOT COMPATIBLE with existing saves **
Refit various weapons on the carrier prior to launch.
Beware, each weapon has advantages and problems, make your choices wisely.

Swap 160mm guns for cruise missiles, or AA for CIWS and even fit 30mm guns instead of AA missiles.

Bridge displays show status for different weapons!
